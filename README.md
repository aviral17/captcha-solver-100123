# Captcha Solver Web Application

This is a responsive, single-file web application built with Tailwind CSS that allows users to input an image URL containing a CAPTCHA, display the image, and simulate solving the CAPTCHA.

## Features
- Dynamic image URL input, defaults to `sample.png`
- Responsive design suitable for mobile and desktop
- Simulated CAPTCHA solving with placeholder logic
- Reset functionality to reload default image

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter or modify the image URL in the input box.
3. Click "Solve" to simulate CAPTCHA solving.
4. Click "Reset" to reload the default image.

## Notes
- The solving function is mocked and returns placeholder text.
- Replace the `solveCaptcha` function with actual OCR or API integration for real CAPTCHA solving.
- Ensure `sample.png` is located in the same directory as this file.

## Dependencies
- Tailwind CSS CDN for styling
